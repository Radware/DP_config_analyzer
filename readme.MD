# DefensePro – Best Practice configuration analyzer:

# Overview 

The script generates multiple csv reports which can help Resident Engineers/TAM’s/PS with DefensePro config audits, traffic stats review and threshold tuning decisions, mapping the settings.


The script interacts with Radware APSolute Vision DefensePro and collects all the necessary data through REST API calls.

5 reports can be generated

		1.  Traffic statistics report.
			Traffic Statistics will create a report in csv format which includes highest traffic utilization average for the configurable historical timeframe in days (default is 1 day) for every policy including the following stats
			#	CPS = Connections Per Second per policy per DefensePro
			#	PPS = Packets Per Second per policy per DefensePro
			#	BPS = Traffic utilization in Mbps per policy per DefensePro
			#	BDOS protected protocols and Normal baseline BPS per policy per DefensePro
			#	DNS protected record types and Normal baseline QPS per policy per DefensePro
			#	CEC = Concurrent established Connections per DefensePro All policies combined
			
			# This report helps understanding volume of the traffic and make threshold based tuning decisions (BDOS, connection limit, traffic filter)
			# Report will be created under /Reports directory. Example /Reports/traffic_stats_20231227-1415.csv
			
		2. Low bdos baselines
			# Low bdos baselines report will create a csv report which includes policies that traffic is above normal baselines and tuning is required
		
		3. High bdos baselines
			# High bdos baselines report will create a csv report which includes policies that the baseline is X times higher than the maximum average traffic (X is configurable - default is 10).
		
		4. DefensePro configuration mapping
			# This report includes DefensePro Configuration mapping in csv format
			
		5. Best practice configuration report
			# This report will check DP configuration and create report when configuration does not comply with best practice. Below checks are included
			
			
			#	- 1.  DefensePro has no catchall policy
			#	- 2.  Policy has no security profiles applied
			#	- 3.  Policy is configured two-way
			#	- 4.  Policy is in report mode
			#	- 5.  Policy is disabled

			#	- 15. DefensePro has no Heartbeat policy for the Silicom Bypass Switch (if exists)
			#	- 16. Catchall policy has not the lowest priority
			#	- 17. Policies distribution across instances is not equal for DefensePro version 7.x 
			#	- 18. BDOS profile is in report mode
			#	- 19. BDOS profile is not applied on any policy(orphaned)
			#	- 20. BDOS profile has Footprint Strictness is not set to Medium 
			#	- 21. BDOS profile learning suppression is less than 50%
			#	- 22. SSH Timeout
			#	- 23. Configuration audit is enabled
			#	- 24. Configuration audit type extended is enabled
			#	- 25. Management access through HTTP is disabled
			#	- 26. Management access through Telnet is disabled
			#	- 27. Web-services is disabled if unnecessary.
			#	- 28. Network class parsing 
			#	-     a. Network class is a subnet of another network class
			#	-     b. Network class is unused(orphaned)
			#	-     c. Same network class is shared with antoher policy
			#	-     d. Network class has a duplicate network with another network class
			#	- 29. Detection if SYN Flood profile is in Report mode

## IMPORTANT

● Read the entire file before attempting to configure/executing.


# Setup

## Requirements

1. The solution requires python 3.6 and higher and installing required libraries

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
 
   ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    # You may need to run `sudo apt-get install python3-venv` first on Debian-based OSs
    python3 -m venv .venv

    # Windows
    # You can also use `py -3 -m venv .venv`
    python -m venv .venv

    #Activeate

    # On Windows: 
    
    .venv\Scripts\activate

    #Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate   


   ```

3. Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## How to run

1. Create config.py file from `config.py example`
2. Open "config.py" and set the mandatory and optional variables (read config.py comments with explanations).
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script and run the script from that directory.

python3 main.py

Notes:

Script can be run with the following arguments (multiple arguments may be combined together)

python3 main.py --use-cache-data
-	Script parses previously collected data only (stage 2 only, no data collection)

python3 main.py --email
-	Script runs and sends email at the end (requires SMTP configuration block to be set)

python3 main.py --test-email"
-	Script runs test email function to test email server connectivity.
